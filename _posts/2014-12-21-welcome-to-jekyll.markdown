Hello there!

My name is __Christopher Rodriguez__, and I run this site.

I'll be discussing the different projects I am working on each day,
including such widely varying subjects as:

- Board Games
- Video Games
- Short Stories
- Visual Novels
- Web Design
- Scripting
- Music

It's my hope that this blog will keep me focused, and give me
something to look back on in a year to prove that I have indeed been
productive.

Check out the [my homepage][cdr255] if You'd like to see the fruits of
my labor after the fact. If You have an idea for a project You'd like me to work on, or an improvement to one of my projects, [email me][email]. And follow me on [Twitter][twitter] for more to-the-minute ideas, too.
