Tonight, I replace the two broken levers on my harp (with pictures
illustrating the process, too!).

### Step One: Assessment of Damage ###

[![A Picture of my Two Broken Levers](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/small-broken-harps.jpg){: .graphic}](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/broken-harps.jpg)

As You can see, it is merely the handle which is broken on them
both. This has been an uncommon, but still present, risk with my harp:
If I am ever too rough with it, especially while moving it, lever
handles _WILL_ snap.

I've heard  it is less  common for other lever  types (I have  a Camac
harp with  Camac Levers)  but I  am not  willing to  pay for  the full
switch  over...   Plus,  as  I   found  out  during  my   locating  of
replacements, Camac has _extraordinary_  customer service... even if I
did have to pay to have them shipped from France.

So, to get the the point, I need to remove the two broken handles and
replace them with better, not-broken ones.

### Step Two: Assemble Tools and Parts ###

I'll be honest, I was expecting it to be much more difficult to do
this. You need a screwdriver or two (I have one with changable bits)
in the sizes of T5, and either T9 or F9. You also need a steady hand,
a replacement handle, and (if Yours are as dusty as mine) a rag to
clean everything up while working.`

I fix a lot of things, so I had the bits I needed. But if You don't
have anything, buying all of the tools to do this fix shouldn't cost
more than $10... not including the replacement handles, of course,
which are for sale [here][handles].

### Step Three: Removal of Lever and Handle ###

Unfortunately, I do have bad news: The levers are spaced so tightly
together that there is _no way_ I could have removed the handles
without removing the entire lever from the instrument. This means
that, after completing this fix, You will need to __REGULATE__ the
strings in question again, at the very least. If it has been a while
(It had been, for me) then this would actually be a good time to do a
FULL regulation. I'll explain how I regulate my harp in another post,
and link it here when I do.

Remove the levers with the T9 or the F9 screwdriver. Protip: The
levers should be in the __OFF__ position before You do so, or they
will cling to the string after the screws are removed.

There are two (2) screws holding the handle to the lever, and a small
part of the handle wedges into a groove underneath it as well. Remove
both screws (Allow the lever to change positions if it wants to;
Removing the handle made my lever turn to __ON__). Once the screws are
removed, gently but firmly pull the broken handle off of the lever. It
should have a small bit of resistance, but easily come off.

### Step Four: Replace New Handle ###

If the screws do not appear stripped, use the same ones and save Your
replacements for later. Otherwise, replace them, lest the handle break
again (I have a rivalry going with my A4 and B4 levers. They hate me.).

Before screwing the handle in, though, make sure the wedge of the handle is firmly... wedged... in the groove on the lever. If You hold the lever with the face of the handle facing the ground, the handle will not fall off... providing the wedge is secured tightly.

After it is, screw the handle down to fully secure it.

### Step Five: Replace Lever on Instrument ###

[![Picture of the Lever on the Instrument Again](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/small-fixed-harp-1.jpg){: .graphic}](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/fixed-harp-1.jpg)

Putting the lever back on is tricky. Do __NOT__ use new holes for the
screws; mine were flattened screws, even, to prevent me from doing
this. In fact, never drill any part of Your harp... if You can help
it.

Instead (with the lever in the __OFF__ position and without the
screws) position it so that the string is securely held by the lever
and the holes for the lever are fully visible through the holes _on_
the lever. Then, simply engage the lever (turn it to the __ON__
position) and it will hold itself there while You screw the screws in
through the properly positioned holes.

__NOTE__: If You are regulating these levers (You __REALLY__ need to
do this) do not screw the screws all of the way in. Instead, leave
them about a half turn unscrewed: Tight enough to keep the lever from
moving on its own, but loose enough that You can move it as You
regulate.

### Step Six: Repeat for Remaining Levers ###

Go back to __Step Three__ and repeat unitl You have no more broken
levers.

### Step Seven: Regulate ###

Again, I will go into this more in a later post, but the basic idea is
the same as positioning a movable bridge on a banjo or violin: The
distance between the part of the lever which contacts the string and
the soundboard needs to be perfectly positioned, so that when the
lever is engaged Your previously-in-tune string is still in tune, just
a half step higher. Here are some quick rules of thumb:

- Make sure the open string is in tune first. (VITAL)

- If the levered note is sharp, the lever is too low. Disengage it,
  loosen the screws a tad, and raise the lever just a hair (until the
  levered note sounds true.

- If the levered note is flat, the lever is too high. Disengage it,
  loosen the screws a tad, and lower the lever just a hair (until the
  levered note sounds true)

- If You get frustrated, take a break. This kind of work requires
  patience and practice. If You rush, You will (at best) fail to
  regulate the string or (at worst) break the string or damage the
  lever.

For more info, I will be making a post sometime in January here.

Here is a streamlined (TL;DR) version of the above process:

1. Check Damage, noting how many need to be fixed.
2. Assemble Parts and Tools (Handles, T5 and T9 (or 5/32 Flathead) Screwdrivers, rage and steady hand). 
3. Remove lever from instrument.
4. Remove broken handle.
5. Replace new handle.
6. Replace lever on harp.
7. Repeat 3-7 for all broken levers
8. Regulate, at a minimum, all replaced levers.

### Buying from Camac ###

[![A Picture of the Lever-Bags I recieved from Camac](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/small-levers-in-bags.jpg){: .graphic}](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/levers-in-bags.jpg)

I buy all of my levers direct from Camac, now. They are extremely
cordial and got me my levers in exactly 12 days, during the Holiday
season, from France. [Here][handles] is their website, though it is
closed until the new year begins. And here are direct links to sets of
10 [small][small], [medium][medium], and [large][large] levers (even
though I was replacing levers in the middle of my harp's range (I have
a Camac Hermine) I still needed to use [small][small] levers. So, if
You are ordering only one size, that is most likely the needed size if
the note in question is above middle C).


Hopefully this helps. If You have any questions, feel free to ask in
an [email][email] or in the comments below.
