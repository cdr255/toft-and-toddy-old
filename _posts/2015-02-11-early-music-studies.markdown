Today, I want to outline the beginnings of a new project: I am
restarting my studies of Early Music, and I will be recording my
experiences as I go!

### My Love for Early Music ###

[![A Picture of Some Illuminated Music](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/small-02-15-ave-maria.jpg "Hymn Ave Maria Gratia. Source: James Freeman, at publicdomainreview.org"){: .graphic}](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/02-15-ave-maria.jpg)

Anyone who knows me knows about my love for some fairly odd forms of
music. I listen to a lot of Traditional music (Mostly [Irish][irish]
and [Spanish][spanish]/[Latin][latin]), [J-Pop][jpop], and
[Video Game][vgm] / [Chiptune][chiptune] music. But above all else, I
have a deep love for [Early Music][early].

[Early Music][early] is basically any extant music from the
pre-Classical period in Europe (and sometimes other places, too). This
includes, majorly, music from the [Baroque][baroque],
[Renaissance][renaissance], and [Medieval][medieval] periods... but
can go much further back, at times.

I used to study it rather fervantly (at least, I thought so), but fell
off the wagon a while back when my grandmother passed away. I have
decided to take steps back towards my studies in 2015, with the hopes
of once again making progress in this wonderful rabbit hole that is
musical history.

### My Instruments, as of Now ###

[![My Harp, and my two Recorders- a Soprano and a Sopranino](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/small-02-15-harp-and-recorders.jpg "My two recorders- a Yamaha Soprano and an Alder Sopranino- and my Harp, a Camac Hermine."){: .graphic}](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/02-15-harp-and-recorders.jpg)

As it stands, I currently have three instruments which fit well into
this type of music: A Harp, and two Recorders. (Yes, a recorder is a
legitimate instrument. It is used extensively throughout Early
repertoire, only becoming supplanted when the Classical era began).

My [Harp][leverharp], I have [mentioned before][fixlevers], but is
invaluable to my study of this kind of music. In fact, the harp is one
of the few instruments which is able to play more than one line at
once in this period- most instruments were, instead,
[monophonic][monophonic]. It is also useful because, unlike monophonic
instruments from this time, it can easily take the role of any voice
in a piece- from Bass to Sopranino, if need be.

The [Recorder][recorder] can still play in a chromatic range, but is
limited in a similar fashion to the [violin][violin] today, or the
human [voice][voice]. That is, it has a limited range, filling only
one voice's role in a piece (Soprano, for instance). I am also much
less experienced on the recorder, which (obviously) will change as I
mature in this style of music. I am happy to have one each of the C
and F recorders, tho- that way, I can play any piece written for them
that I might find.

### An Instrument of my Desires ###

[![Crumhorns by Michael Praetorius](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/small-02-15-crumhorns.png "Crumhorns drawing by Michael Praetorius in Syntagma Musicum c. 1615"){: .graphic}](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/02-15-crumhorns.png)

I will eventually obtain a [Crumhorn][crumhorn] for myself. I have
wanted one for a few years now, as it is probably my favorite
Early-Music-Exclusive instrument, in terms of sound and character. It
is a [Windcap][windcap] instrument, which uses a double-reed (making
it sound somewhat similar to the modern day [Oboe][oboe] or
[Bassoon][bassoon].

The problem, of course, is the price: A starter, plastic body crumhorn
in F Soprano runs about [$330][susatocrum], and then I would also need
a method book and shipping. So, when next I amass a spare $400, I will
be putting the bulk of it towards getting myself one of these. Until then, I will practice on the instruments I have.

### Repertoire and Products ###

[![Mensural Manuscript of Missa de Beata Virgine](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/small-02-15-kyrie.jpg "c. ~1500 manuscript by Josquin des Prez of Missa de Beata Virgine, in Mensural Notation"){: .graphic}](https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/02-15-kyrie.jpg)

For repertoire, I will delve into the many Albums I have amassed over
the years, as well as look through some manuscripts of which I am
lucky enough to have digital copies. As I play them, learn them, and
master them, I am planning on also recording them (possibly on
[Youtube][youtube] or [Soundcloud][soundcloud]) to share with
everyone. I will also try to always include both modern and mensural
notation for any piece I choose to record.

As this develops, I expect my output will increase to a regular
interval. But, for now, this will be a "When it is done, it will be
uploaded" kind of project. I will post semi-regular updates here,
though. So, stay tuned!

If You have any experience with Early Music, or questions, comments,
concerns, criticisms, or suggestions, feel free to

respond as I am able. Talk to You soon!
