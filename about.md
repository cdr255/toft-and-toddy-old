### About This Site ###

_Last Updated: February 13th, 2015_

I have started a __LOT__ of blogs over the years.

Most were dedicated to a single concept: Video Games, Writing, Music,
etc. I would post to them on an arbitrary schedule, then I would find
myself drifting towards other aspects of my life and thus I would not
keep up with posting to that blog. Finally, the cycle re-began each
time I would look at the old, dead site and decided to begin anew, and
*this* time I would post to it regularly.

That's why I have recently switched to two main blogs:
[This One][toft], which is my blog for work, projects, and basically
any productive (that is, working towards some kind of product)
work. And [Tumbling Owl][tumblingowl], which is my personal blog (for
things like reflection, personal issues, reviews, and things which do
_not_ work towards a product).

I will talk about anything I want on either, of course. But the goal
is to have these two blogs completely represent me in terms of my
writing.
